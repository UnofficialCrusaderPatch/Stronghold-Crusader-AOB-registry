# Stronghold-Crusader-AOB-registry
AOB (Array of Bytes) registry for the Unofficial Crusader Patch of Stronghold Crusader

## Description
This repository is meant to address the challenge that Crusader has multiple binary exe files: a different exe for different languages and a different exe for Crusader and Crusader Extreme.

The reliance on AOB's of the UCP3 makes it essential to use AOB's that work across different exe files. Within a language this is easy, across language this is hard.

This repository contains tools and solutions to address this problem.

It also contains an index of all the AOB's currently in use by the UCP3.
